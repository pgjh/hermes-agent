"""Tests for gateway /goal verdict-message delivery.

The judge verdict message ("✓ Goal achieved", "⏸ budget exhausted", etc.)
must reach the user after each turn. Before this fix the code checked
``hasattr(adapter, "send_message")`` — but adapters expose ``send()``,
never ``send_message``, so the check always evaluated False and users
never saw verdicts. This test locks in the fix.
